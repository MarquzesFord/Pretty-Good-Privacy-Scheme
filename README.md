# The Pretty Good Privacy cryptographic scheme combines both symmetric
# and asymmetric cryptography to ensure the confidentiality of files. Symmetric
# cryptography is chosen for its speed in handling encryption and decryption,
# particularly for large files. However, it becomes less ideal when the symmetric
# key isn’t shared between sender and recipient. Asymmetric cryptography is
# selected to securely transfer the symmetric key from sender to recipient by
# encrypting it with the recipient’s public key.
